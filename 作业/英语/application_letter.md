Dear Professor Kaiming He,

I am writing to express my interest in joining your research group as a PhD student in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Generative Computing (AIGC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After thoroughly reviewing your groundbreaking work in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV, I am eager to contribute to and learn from the innovative research being conducted under your supervision.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Harbin Engineering University, where I focused on machine learning and natural language processing. My thesis, titled "A Music Game Auto-Generating Application Based on LLG," explored the application of deep learning techniques to music-sense contribution, yielding significant improvements in AIGC. This experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in AI methodologies and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve.

My research interests align closely with your work on CNNs and computer vision. I am particularly fascinated by your recent publication on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), which addressed critical advancements in the CV area. The potential applications of this research in fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics are immense, and I am excited about the possibility of contributing to such impactful work.

During my academic and research career, I have developed proficiency in several programming languages, including Python and TensorFlow, and have gained experience in various AI frameworks and tools. Additionally, I have co-authored 2 papers published in SCI-E, demonstrating my ability to conduct and communicate high-quality research.

MIT's collaborative environment and its emphasis on interdisciplinary research make it an ideal place for me to pursue my doctoral studies. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work with and learn from the leading experts in AIGC and to contribute to projects that have the potential to revolutionize the field.

I am confident that my background, skills, and research aspirations make me a strong candidate for your research group. I am eager to discuss how my experiences and goals align with the ongoing projects in your lab. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research team.

Sincerely,

Yihang Wang
